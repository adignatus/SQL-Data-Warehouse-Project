# Diagrams stored in docs/diagrams

This folder contains the Draw.io (.drawio) source files for architecture and data-model diagrams used in this project. Commit includes the following files:

- Data Flow Diagram.drawio
- Integration Model.drawio
- Sales Data Mart (Star Schema).drawio
- SQL DWH Project (Data Architecture Diagram).drawio

PNG export recommendation
- Default width commonly used: 1200px.
- Recommendation: export PNGs at 1600px width for improved readability on large screens and in docs that may be zoomed. If you prefer to keep 1200px, no change is needed.

How to export
- Open the .drawio file in draw.io (https://app.diagrams.net) or in the desktop app
- File → Export → PNG. Set Width to 1600 (or 1200) and enable "Include a copy of my diagram" if you want embedded XML.

If you want, I can also export PNGs and push them into the same folder at the chosen width (default: 1600px). Reply with the preferred width or "keep 1200px" if you want 1200px.
